# Binary-Classifier-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
I have made this binary classifier while importing datasets from scikit learn machine learning library using perceptron learning algorithm while implementing gradient descent and plotting decision boundaries, splitting the data into using training and testing sets and futher applied a single layer perceptron causing it to be a shallow model.
